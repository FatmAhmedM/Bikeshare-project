	I have searched a way to get a list of month insted of writing it myself I've found stackoverflow help: 				https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66790398/how-to-generate-month-names-as-list-in-python 
    also I have use it for days
    and (if m != '') part is used because when I ran the code separatly I have found that it prints a list of months PLUS this '' element 		which will intrupt the code.
    
    
2.
