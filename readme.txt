Hello!
This is a reference of the new ideas that I had applied in the code and how I tried to complete it

1. 
	I have divided every section to and test it in another file to make sure it is working before running the whole code.


2. to handle the input data:
	I have searched a way to get a list of month insted of writing it myself I've found stackoverflow help: 				https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66790398/how-to-generate-month-names-as-list-in-python 
    also I have use it for days
    and (if m != '') part is used, because when I ran the code separatly I have found that it prints a list of months PLUS this '' element 		which will intrupt the code.
    
    
3.
	for the last part of the code concerning birth year I can't use mode() method for either array or list so I searched a way to solve that 	and I found (import statistics ) way
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10797819/finding-the-mode-of-a-list
    
4.for the combination trip requirment here the ref I have used:
